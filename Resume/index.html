                the gaming industry, organizational and<br />
                administration experience from other fields
                of work will certainly come in handy. For<br />
                example, frequent engagement and communication
                with clients and customers, organizing work<br />
                schedules, archiving, problem-solving based
                on coworker suggestions, keeping track of<br />
                sales and other transactions, etc.
